### Huge Obligatory Disclaimer!

<span class="disclaimer">I am **not** affiliated with the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other US alphabet soup organization.  I am **not** a lawyer, **nor** a black/white hat.  All of this is just a **proof of concept** (no warranty!).</span>

<span class="disclaimer">We are **not** sniffing live traffic of others (just our own).  All pre-generated traffic (in `cap` or `pcap` files) were either downloaded from a [common repository](http://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures) for testing purposes, is or _my own traffic_ that I'm not shy to share.</span>

<span class="disclaimer">In **no way** is this tutorial teaching how one can capture live traffic from unknowing victims, nor is it storing such traffic.  I **am not** condoning sitting in a cafe with free & unprotected wifi and [capturing your fellow coffee & free wifi lovers' traffic](https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/WLAN).</span>


<span class="disclaimer">Now that's out of the way...</span>
