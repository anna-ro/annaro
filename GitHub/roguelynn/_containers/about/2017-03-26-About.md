An insomniac site relability engineer for [Spotify][spotify], founder of the [San Francisco Chapter][meetup] of [PyLadies][pyladies], former vice chair and board member of the [Python Software Foundation][psf], and member of the [Django Software Foundation][dsf].

I have a business degree in finance and economics, but fell in love with programming in 2011.  More on my journey about how I became a software engineer can be found in [this post][path].

I like to speak. A [lot][talks]. I particularly talk on the Python community, as well as the technical work that Iâ€™ve done. [Email][email] me if you would like to make my talks list longer.

I respond to [Twitter][twitter] faster than [email][email].  My [projects][projects] can be found on [GitHub][github].  Publishable photos of me for conferences and such can be found [here][photos].

Writings and thoughts on this site are my own.
