A few of us at Spotify are infatuated with [RAML][0] - a RESTful API Modeling Language described as “a simple and succinct way of describing practically-RESTful APIs”, extremely similar goal of [Swagger][1].

I'm pleased to announce the initial release of [RAMLfications][11], a Python package that parses RAML and validates it based on the [specification][5] into Python objects.

```python
>>> from ramlfications import parse
>>> RAML_FILE = "/path/to/some/file.raml"
>>> api = parse(RAML_FILE)
>>> api.base_uri
'https://{subdomain}.example.com/v1/{communityPath}'
>>> api.resources
[ResourceNode(method='get', path='/widgets'),
 ResourceNode(method='get', path='/widgets/{id}'),
 ResourceNode(method='get', path='/widgets/{id}/gizmos'),
 ResourceNode(method='get', path='/thingys')]
```

```python
>>> widget = api.resources[1]
>>> widget.name
'/{id}'
>>> widget.description
[Get a Widget](https://developer.example.com/widgets/)
>>> widget.description.html
u'<p><a href="https://developer.example.com/widgets/">Get a Widget</a></p>\n'
>>> widget.uri_params
[URIParameter(name='id'), URIParameter(name='communityPath')]
```

It's available on [PyPI][6] with documentation on [Read the Docs][4] and code released under the [Apache 2.0][7] license available on Spotify's [GitHub][8].

There are still some [features that need to be implemented][9], and I am sure there are some bugs (please [report][10] them!), hence the initial beta release.

### Why?

Last year, I built our developer [API console][2], allowing folks a playground for understanding our [Web APIs][3].  The console first parses a RAML file that defines the API, then creates a set of forms based off of RAML, allowing a user-friendly way to directly interact with our Web API service.

One of the highlights of this console is the fact that *none* of the application itself (except for the HTML/CSS) is Spotify specific.  This allows others to easily maintain the app, only editing our RAML file then restarting the service.

### What's next

I have plans to open source our API console that uses RAMLfications so others can easily create their own interactive environment.

My next hack project is to also write a documentation generator based off of RAML (of course, using `ramlfications`).  Currently, RAML supports Markdown (and plaintext) for `description` and `documentation` elements within a RAML file.  So using `ramlfications`, I'll probably end up hacking on top of a static site generator.  Stay tuned!
