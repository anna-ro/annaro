## TODO

### Ze data
* grab Python meetups, grab PyLadies meetups:
    * of the locations that have both pyladies and python groups:
        * % of shared members
        * gender distribution guestimate
        * histogram of gender distribution (past 5 years?)
    * of locations w/ just python (not pyladies)
        * gender distribution guestimate
        * histogram of gender distribution (past 5 years?)
        * histogram of new membership - compared to locations w/ local pyladies
    * histogram of:
        * new pyladies locations
        * membership among pyladies locations
* conferences:
    * histogram of gender distribution for:
        * attendees
        * speakers (talks, tutorials, LTs, posters)
    * rise of regional conferences - reach out to major regionals and ask about gender distribution
* disclaimer: this applies to all diversity areas, focusing on gender
* questions I see get asked all the time:
    * I'm too afraid to ask questions, to even say anything for fear of offending someone
    * Where can I learn more about $x?
        * let me google that for you
        * shit to google:
            * unconscious bias


## Thesis


Python community is seen as a leader among other tech communities for the efforts we've put in.  If we don't continue the work we're doing, we'll lose that lead.

And we've done a lot! We've seen the effects of working on the low-hanging fruit to improve gender diversity within the Python community.  But we're not done.



## More broad overview

* Women file only about 7.5% of all patents <sup>[0][freaktranscript]</sup>

## Field study

To test if men were more inclined for competition than women, one study was performed in two different locations:


### Masai in Africa, in Tanzania

#### About the culture
> The Masai is a very extreme patriarchal society in which is you ask a man how many kids he has he will tell you how many boys he has. Women cost about 10 cows, so they are the property of their husband. If the husband doesn’t like what the wife is doing, he can beat her, he can abuse her.

> The men are usually in their late 20s to 30s when they marry and they often have multiple wives. Their brides, generally teens, undergo female genital mutilation before marriage. Women do much of the hard labor. As one woman said, “Men treat us like donkeys.”


### Khasi in northeast India

#### About the culture
The Khasi are one of the world’s few matrilineal societies, where the youngest Khasi daughter inherits the family’s money and property, men move into their wives’ houses when they marry, and children take their mother’s family name. Overall, life for the Khasi women is pretty good.

In the Khasi Hills where they live, they clearly have a much higher standing than probably anywhere else in the world. The women are in charge. The women decide what kind of crops they’re going to raise. They are in charge of deciding how to spend the money, the family’s money. The household decisions are theirs. They go to the market to sell the items. When you go to visit their home, they will greet you. They are just used to being considered equal to the men.

### The test

Participants were asked to toss a tennis ball underhanded into a bucket about 10 feet away. They had 10 chances. They were matched with another unidentified person playing the same game on the other side of the building.

The experimenter explained to them the task, you know, throwing the ball into the bucket and asked them a very simple question: Do you want to be paid say one dollar per every success? It wasn’t a dollar, but it was equivalent to that. Or, you can be paid three dollars for every success that you have for every ball that lands in the bucket, but only if you do better than the person behind the corner.

Basically, if the player picked the more competitive option, they could get paid three times the amount of money.

### Results

#### Masai

Many more men chose to compete than women. About twice as many men chose to compete than women did, which is very much in line with what we observe when we run it in the U.S., or any Western society.

Fifty percent of Masai men chose the more competitive option. Meaning they chose to be paid more money if they made more baskets than the person around the corner. The women had less appetite for risk. Twenty-six percent of the women chose the more competitive option. Now, this may not come as a huge surprise, that men raised in an extreme patriarchy are more competitive than women.

#### Khasi

Fifty-four percent of Khasi women picked the more competitive option. Thirty-nine percent of Khasi men made the same choice. Khasi women were more likely to choose to compete than even the super-patriarchal Masai men we heard about earlier.

### Conclusion

Even if women are born more innately less competitive, "the culture is so big, can be so big that it can just overturn the results."

> So if you grow up in a matrilineal society, women are actually more competitive than men. So it can completely override any evolutionary explanation, any nature kind of reason. Nurture could be that big. And I think that’s the main result of this study is that in the right environment, women are going to be just as competitive as men.

## What we've done


## Myths to debunk


* “Gender equality - that is not a problem here! Those things don’t matter!” - they shouldn’t be said anymore. If a man says it, can make a woman question her beliefs.  What you’re actually saying “That is not a problem to me.”  Is it just not a problem because it’s not a problem to you?
    * see the numbers
* “Time will solve that!”  - time doesn’t solve anything; if you want to give people the right to vote, saving the rain forest - takes action.  Can’t just lean back
* “That is not our responsibility!”
* “Sure, we wanted the women but … we couldn’t find them.”   Other versions of this quote:
    * “we went with our gut feeling” - do not ever use your gut feeling! that will be stereotypes and prejudice, keeps you away from uncomfortable and awkward! Need to *challenge* your gut feeling, use your brain.
    * “What is your problem with George?” already/always caring about the folks that are already included
    * “We were in a hurry” - if you really care about those things, then would have start incorporating diversity
    * “I know George is great for this!” - if you want to change something, call someone else - the one that you’re not familiar with
    * “Hold it - Not picking George would be discrimination!” - still not thinking about the folks that are already excluded
    * “We tried X once - didn’t work” -
* “But we only focus on quality here, not gender!” - quality is not an objective word, together or alone we decide.  Do we encourage uniqueness? or rawness? or authenticity? sensitivity? what other values to we add to “quality”?  This excuse is just “we don’t want to change what we’re doing here”.  “Quality to me is music by men”. wat.
* “Women are not interested in this” - implying that this is women’s fault. “We don’t get resumes from women for this internship.” Are women really not that interested? Created Tekla - robots, tech, computers, gaming.  Proved that this _is_ something girls are interested in, as long as they are invited, and not _the girl_ of the group, on their terms.
* Argument that if we focus on women, men won’t get hired
    * SK: fallacy of this all that there is some sacrifice that will be made; lowering the standards. It’s bullshit. Seen it in same exact resume but change the name.  Making sure that everyone that is qualified is being considered.  Not factually backed up. Technical term: “bullshit”.
* quotas are bad:
    * turn it against the quota nay-sayers.  What if we publicly say “we’ll only hire 90% white men?” since that is our current percentage.
    * keeps accountability
    * Folks confusing the “recruit your friends” is synonymous with “recruiting for quality/qualified people”.
* Sort of a notion that there is a bad guy behind it.  A lot of attention given to someone who says that something bad, and everyone says “there’s the bad guy!” But we’re all the “bad guy” - all complicit.
Recruitment: cash bonus, recruit your friends.  Look at people’s networks, 99% of white people in America have vast majority of white connections.  Automatically exclude when recruiting like that.

## Problem

* Being good at making apps is completely unrelated to management.  However that is the path - work on iOS for a while then be promoted into management (and never get to code again).  These are the classes they skipped in university - how to create a diverse workforce under themselves.  These new managers are coders with no training/education.
* status quo
    * After 10 years of work experience, “[The Athena Factor][1]” found, 41% of women in tech leave the industry, compared with 17% of men. [0][0]
        - When women quit tech, they don't leave the workforce entirely. And it's not about having families: They're no likelier than women in other industries to cite “work-life balance” as their reason for leaving.

## Facts

* Bechtel test - This is a real simple way to show that movies are telling the public what it is important
    * Bechtel test for code
    * Bechtel test for companies - who leads them (e.g. who makes the movies)
* Fortune 500's top tech companies [2][2]

## The Future: what to do

> There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, “Morning, boys, how's the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, “What the hell is water?”
> <small> David Foster Wallace, [This is Water][thisiswater]


### low hanging fruit
* Bulk-buy
    * higher groups, not individuals; promote groups, not individuals
    * take a look at the folks (I bet mostly women!) make less under your management, automatically bump them up. one and done.
* When in doubt, focus on women. what is the female perspective (female-first development)
    * new world order marketing: female informed
    * women are the primary buyers or primary influences
        * more women in US hold drivers licenses than men
        * 53% of new car purchases are women
        * but auto companies still target men
        * women buy, and women _share_
            * "share the shit out of everything that men don’t"
            * women will influence men more than men influence
    * huge amount of $ to be made when women are taken seriously
* Make the default pronoun female on our imagery/product/etc
* Donald Stufft came directly to PyLadies when he needed help because he saw a lack of diversity in that subcommunity of python, offered mentorship. was scared no one would be interested. got 4 women within the first hour

### more difficult
* prepare to get uncomfortable
    * it’s very comfortable hiring/working/hanging out/co-founding business w/ people like yuo
    * but we must be prepared to get uncomfortable
    * we (women) ask the tough questions in business, life… “what are you thinking? what is this relationship going?” - “why are we spending money on that"
    * if the only woman in the room, say what you really think
* become aware of the unconscious
    * Signaling:
        - “Hack Away” - gone to enormous lengths to garner diversity, put thought into how to promote Hack Away
            - put a photograph about what it means for a hackathon
            - included a women's swim suit - attracted a lot of women to actually join the hackathon (see landing page: http://www.hackaway.com/ )
            - different reaction when promoting beer pong
        - lead hackathons? provide child care, yoga/walking/hiking sessions, avoid pizza


## Slide quotes

> There’s little correlation between a group’s collective intelligence and the IQs of its individual members. But if a group includes more women, its collective intelligence rises.
[Harvard Business Review][hbr]

> …creativity depends on our life experiences.
> Without diversity, the life experiences we bring to an engineering problem are limited.
> As a consequence, we may not find the best engineering solution.
> We may not find the elegant engineering solution.
[National Academy of Engineering][nae]

> …when groups of intelligent individuals are working to solve hard problems, the diversity of the problem solvers matters more than their individual ability.
> Thus, diversity is not distinct from enhancing overall quality—it is integral to achieving it.
[Scientific American][sa]

> …chronic and woeful underrepresentation in the workforce leads to “the inescapable conclusion that we are missing critical contributors to our talent pool.”
> It is hard to grow a workforce —let alone get the “best” workforce— when there’s broad underrepresentation of up to 75 percent of the potential talent pool.
[Scientific American][sa]
