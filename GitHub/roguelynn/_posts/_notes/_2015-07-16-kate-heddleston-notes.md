### Intro

#### Why does diversity matter?

* Canary in the coal mine, told to "lean in"
* 40% of female engineers are leaving the industry [source][0], leads to an unhealthy and potentially dangerous situation
* kills creativity , problem-solving, productivity

#### Environments

* David Foster Wallace quote [1][1] (pdf) showing lack of awareness
* unspoken understandings, assumptions, biases about what it means to work, communicate
* largely unaware of unconscious biases
	* is arguing the best way for people to figure out solutions of technical problems
	* more critical of some people than others
	* does that stupid idea really deserve to be publicly shot down?
	
#### Why is it important to talk about environments?

* understand environmental and institutional factors that affect people's behavior, ability to be successful at their jobs
* environmental/institutional factors are more powerful than any one individual
