Guten tag, all. I just had an awesome weekend.  I attended [San Francisco Science Hack Day][Hackathon] and it was *awesome*!  

It was two **full days**, so let me lay it out for you: **about me:**programming & science n00b **mission:**to make & hack things with SCIENCE **vision:**to hack data from Switzerland's Large Hadron Collider for better accessibility and understanding, esp for enthusiasts but n00bs like me. **results:**

-   my knowledge of particle physics went from 0 to ... some? probably 1
    if it's on a scale of ...100.
-   crash course in python and javascript programming
-   +5lbs from bountiful free food and alcohol
-   Increased tolerance to caffeine
-   I made [THIS][THIS1]!
-   The group collectively put [THIS][THIS2] website together!
-   10 GBs of LHC data, out of the gazillion terabytes of data both available & unavailable to the "public" (I say with quotes because not exactly sure where I could even get the publicly released data...)

Note: If you're interested in the source code, it can be found on GitHub under mattbellis. So, what those two graphs mean that I put together is [I THINK, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY] a reflection of two different ways to calculate mass of muons. Muons produce when two protons collide together, along with other particles, including mesons. The second graph (using Einstein's equations/special relativity), you can see a second "hump", signaling that there actually is a second meson existing that the first graph didn't show. All 'n all, thanks to my intro course to computer science, I was able to have somewhat of an understanding of what was going on, as well as built upon my skills (especially for my final project coming up!).   All I have to say for those n00bs to any new skill: Dive right in.  That's the best, most fun way to learn!
