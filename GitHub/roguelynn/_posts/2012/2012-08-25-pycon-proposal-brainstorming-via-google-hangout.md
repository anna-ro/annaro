Ever thought about speaking? Want to give speaking at [PyCon][PyCon] a shot, but not sure what to talk about? Even if you have a tiny inkling that you'd want to speak, beginner level or advanced, come to our workshop to get help brainstorming ideas & learn what makes a good proposal! 

[Join the PyLadies hangout][Join], open to **PyLadies** and **PyLaddies**, with help from PyLadies' leaders, previous years PyCon speakers & current Program Committee members (e.g. the folks that review proposals) to ideate, write, and submit your proposal to speak, give a tutorial, or a poster session at PyCon 2013. Space is limited by the Google Hangout technology. An invite link will be sent out about 15 minutes prior to the start time. For those in the Bay Area, be sure to check out the PyLadies San Francisco meetup, [Workshop: Talk Proposal Writing for PyCon][Workshop], on Tuesday, August 28th.
