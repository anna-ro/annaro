I've collected many bookmarks related to Python, programming, computer science, etc.  

It's time I cleaned it out and organized it better.  In the midst of doing this, I found some really awesome sites, libraries, tutorials, etc that need to be shared.  I still have plenty of bookmarks that are great resources, but I didn't want to inondate readers :). I've loosely divided them up by experience level.  Here goes: 

#### Beginner:

1.  [Advice][Advice] on learning how to program.
2.  Model, View, Controller [explained][MVC].
3.  Basic Python Syntax [Tutorial][Syntax]. (Helpful for both new toprogramming in general, and new to Python with prior programming experience).
4.  Colorful Git [Tutorial][Git1].
5.  Git Tutorial based on [missions to complete][Git2].

#### Advanced Beginner/Intermediate:

1.  Git [Tutorial][Git3]for Scientists (although, you don't need to be ascientist to get the benefit of this tutorial).
2.  Bash Shell [Cheat Sheet][Bash] (Linux/Mac).  I'm in love with Bash.
3.  Django tutorial:[A simple Blog][Django] (uses an old version of Django).
4.  [bpython][bpython]: an overlay to the Python interpreter.  Features in-linesyntax highlighting, autocomplete suggestions, displays a list of parameters when calling a function, displays what's inside of the libraries when you import.  This is a lightweight IDE for the terminal/Python shell.  Awesome!

#### Experience Agnostic:

1.  Awesome little [Python library][PEP8]: checks to see if your Python file is PEP-8 compliant.
2.  [Git Widget/Cheat sheet][Git4] for Mac (lives on your dashboard for easy access).
3.  [List][Companies]of internet companies that use Python.
