What a blast I had on Saturday! It was a great learning experience for both the attendees and for us PyLadies org board!  

Good lessons learned, such as virtualenv is a beast to install depending on one's operating system.  Next time, we'll have a pre-workshop session for installation of dependencies and such. We went through how to build a blog using Django and its class-based views.  We also went over Model-View-Controller concepts, and how they apply to Django.  We wrapped up with a quick overview of how easy it is to deploy an application on Heroku (way too easy!). 

I've made a [GitHub repo][repo] for people to fork & contribute. I didn't find an easily accessible tutorial for building a blog, or for building a simple app using Django's class views, so hopefully this will grow to something useful in the Django community. Til next time!
