More and more often, folks have been asking about how I became an engineer, what my "story" is.  So, in the effort to save time and breath, here it is.


**TL;DR**: I have a business degree, and started teaching myself how to code in the fall of 2011.


#### Started in Business

In high school, I really didn't know what I wanted to study or do with my life.   I loved playing the double bass and flute in the school's orchestra.  I even took [IB music][ibmusic] and seriously considered going to [Berklee College of Music][berklee] in Boston.  But I had the foresight to know that I wouldn't make a decent living as a musician.

I _loved_ math and excelled in our [highest available math class][ibmusic], but as a teenager, my brain had trouble trying to turn math into a career beyond being a HS teacher.  So I thought studying business would be a good medium - related to math, but also gives much more opportunity to getting a decent job after college.

So in 2008, I graduated [Babson College][babson] with a undergraduate degree in business management, concentrated in Economics and Finance.  And yes, I certainly did graduate into a horrible economy, but oddly enough I landed a job in Boston at a [bank][bpb] as a Treasury Analyst managing the bank's balance sheet (assets, liabilities, & equity).

It was a pretty awesome job, but I wanted to (or at least thought I did) get a PhD in Economics, as I eventually wanted to work for the Federal Reserve (managing the *US*'s balance sheet!).  I got accepted to a [PhD program][phd] in Frankfurt, Germany, but I couldn't go because the US Department of Education did not recognize it as a legit university, and therefore I could not defer my student loans from undergrad.

So in 2010, I decided to return home to Seattle to hit up the free rent to save up money.  There, I met my current [beau][sp], and in the summer of 2011 he decided to accept a position at Google down in Mountain View (I sort of nudged him as I wanted to get out of Seattle), eventually moving us down to SF.

Being in the Bay Area, I found out about UC Berkeley's [Masters in Financial Engineering][mfe] program, which I thought would be a great detour to get into the Federal Reserve, as I figured I could turn into a "[quant][quant]" and work my way into the Fed through the workforce route, rather than the PhD to post doc to lecturer/professor route.

#### Dipping my Toes into Programming

Welp, that MFE program required applicants to prove knowledge of programming in C/C++, so for the fall of 2011, I took a [course][cs50] through [Harvard's Extension School][harvard].  Because how hard could it be?  I was only a few years out of college.

Well, I sucked.  I failed both midterm exams.  I cried often.  I could not understand pointers and dereferencing.  Stacks, queues, the various sorting algorithms.  All over my head.

The course held a hack day for students at the Harvard campus, but since I was in SF, I decided to find a local one instead - [Science Hack Day][shd].

It was at that hack day that I can pinpoint the *exact* moment that sealed my future, that I decided to continue learning how to code because I liked it, not because I needed to learn it.  I was working with a team that hacked on parsing data from the [LHC][lhc] to make some visualizations.  There, I was introduced to Python.  Looking over someone's shoulder coding in Python, I literally thought,

> ZOMG I CAN ACTUALLY READ THIS. I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING. WTF IS THIS MAGIC.

Returning to my nearly-failed Harvard course, I decided to do my final project with this language that I was just exposed to.  I made a [website][inflatr] that calculated a user's personalized inflation rate over 10 years.  I built the site using [Django][django] because of their awesome [tutorial][djtutorial].

Oddly enough, despite failing both midterms, I received an A- in the course because of my final project (weeee!!!).  And I thought 3am never looked better while trying to debug my stupid little website.  I wanted to continue learning to code, but did not want to pay another $2,000 for a course through Harvard.

#### Drinking the Python Koolaid

I found out about [Women Who Code][wwc] through Meetup, and organized a study group to learn Python in the spring of 2012.  I was a complete *n00b* but women showed up because we were all learning together.

I also heard about [PyCon][pycon] that happened to be down in Santa Clara, and scored a few free tickets for me and a few WWC'ers to attend.  Attending PyCon left me super inspired.  PyLadies of Los Angeles encouraged me to start a PyLadies in San Francisco (which I [did][debut] the following month!).  I also knew I wanted to speak at conferences like PyCon - everyone was so awesome, the crowd, the speakers, the organizers.

Despite only learning how to code for less than a year, I through care to the wind and proposed talks to [DjangoCon EU][djangoconeu], [EuroPython][ep], and [OSCON][OSCON], all of which were accepted.  I spoke about how I was helping to improve diversity of the Python community by somehow convincing women in learning how to code with me.

#### One Year to Engineer

At EuroPython that year, I met a few folks at Red Hat, which is how I landed my [first job][rh] as an engineer in the fall of 2012, and contributed my first patch to my team's OSS [product][freeipa] within [two weeks][twoweeks].  For the year I was there, I integrated the product into [many third party applications][integration], and wrote up one of my most popular blog posts ever: an [explanation of Kerberos][kerberos].

After a year at Red Hat, I decided to move on as I felt I wasn't getting enough support as a new coder.  I left for a [job at Spotify][spotify] in September 2013, originally working as a Partner Engineer (3rd party integrations with our APIs).  Shortly after joining, I moved into a Backend Engineer position because I felt I wasn't coding enough (so many meetings as a Partner Engineer!).

Just recently, my first project that was originally built during an internal hack week, was publicly [released][consolerelease]: an [API Console][console] for external developers to get familiar with our Web APIs.  When I was a Partner Engineer, I got fed up answering the same questions to external partners on how to use our API and OAuth, so I felt something like this would help!  I am also working on many internal diversity initiatives, including integrating the [Ada Initiative][ada]'s [ally's workshop][ally] into our introductory days for new employees.

And that's where I am today. Since starting to learn to code, I've join the Board of Directors on the [Python Software Foundation][psf], I've done some [side projects][sideprojects], including [New Coder][newcoder], as well as lead PyLadies in taking over the [world][pyladieslocations], including the [pyladies][pip] package on [PyPI][pypi].  I still continue to speak [a lot][talks], as well as host workshops for those learning how to code.

Mind you, my journey in learning how to code isn't over.  I'm still very much a n00b, not not as n00b as I once was. :)
