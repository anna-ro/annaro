Five extensive Python tutorials for the new coder.

With some [help][contributions] of my friends in the Python community, Iâ€™ve built 5 digestible projects to gradually progress the Python learner from near drowning to a decent swimmer. The goal is to have new coders feeling accomplished and to continuing learning with: [Data Visualization][dv] with matplotlib; [APIs][apis] with Requests; [Web Scraping][web] with Scrapy and Postgres; [IRC bot][irc] with Twisted; and [Sudoku GUI][gui] with Tkinter.

Presented at [PyCon US 2013][pycon] and [EuroPython 2013][EP], and written up in a [previous post]({{ get_url("words/The-New-Coder-A-path-to-Software-Engineering/")}}).
