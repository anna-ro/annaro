[PyLadies][homepage] is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

PyLadies also aims to provide a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate!

If you are interested in starting a local PyLadies group, have a look through our [kit on GitHub][kit], and feel free to [ask us any questions][email].

PyLadies is under the financial enclave of the [Python Software Foundation][psf]. Any [donation][donate] made to PyLadies is tax-deductible, and will go towards helping women attend Python and Open Source conferences, as well as help broaden its diversity outreach efforts.
