Is a lot of your time wasted from [derping][derp] around on [Reddit][reddit]?  Do you find that you have to correct someone when they’re [**wrong** on the internet][wrong]?  Wish that your collected comment karma was worth something?

Well, I can’t trade you anything for your karma.  But I can provide you with awesome [d3][d3] visualizations of it!

Check out [**www.karmawho.re**][karmawhore] to visualize your <strike>wasted time</strike> collected karma from comment posts.  Search via your Reddit user name, or click “I’m feeling creepy” to visualize comments of a random user.  Try plugging in a few of [these top comment posters][karmawhore.net] if you find that you don’t post enough on Reddit.

Karmawhore was a labor day weekend project using [d3.js][d3], [nvd3][nvd3], and [d3 wordcloud] to bring you these awesome graphs.
